# CS370_Portfolio

For the final project in Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science, I was asked to complete the implementation of a deep Q-learning algorithm in a pathfinding AI. I was given a GameExperience Class, TreasureMaze Class, and the majority of the main game in the python file TreasureHuntGame. The code that I implemented was the training of the neural network to accurately predict the best action given the pirate's state in the game.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists utilize mathematical principles and computer programming principles to develop software and algorithms for the improvement of human life. These programs have enhanced human living as all other technology does and has aided in the development of other sciences such as biology and physics. Mapping the genome of human DNA would not have been possibly without the computational power of computers and the direction of such power through programs. Similarly, simulating physics through the use of computer programs and detailing advanced physics experiments through a combination of programs and sensors would not be feasible without computer scientists.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems from a very detailed and logical perspective. As computer programs are basically logical procedures, being able to detail the steps needed to reach a solution requires a detailed mindset and logical reasoning. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a recent industry in the history of mankind, there are still many ethical issues tied to the development of computer science, namely the privacy of information and the use of AI. As a computer scientist and developer, it is my responsibility to evaluate what I develop for any dependencies that put my clients or customers at risk and properly address the issues, whether that means continued development, warning of possible risks, or halting develop.
